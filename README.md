# Welcome to The Codon Stream
The Codon Stream is a universal hub for knowledge and information. This website was inspired by the Ben 10 TV series' the Codon Stream, a liquid database containing the DNA of sapient beings from across the Milky Way and beyond, housing a total of 1,000,910 DNA samples. It was created by Azmuth to be used to link transformations to the Omnitrix.

As it is universal, it may contain data not suitable for all eyes. I do not intend to make it widely available.
